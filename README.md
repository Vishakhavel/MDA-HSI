# MDA-HSI - Multi-Dimensional Deep Hierarchical Approach Towards Aerial Hyperspectral Image Classification

## Description 

This paper proposes MDA-HSI, a dual model integrated voting network for hyperspectral image classification. The first model employs a 3D-2D hierarchical structure to provide the spectral spatial joint features along with the abstract level spatial representation of 2D CNNs. The second model is a 3D CNN where the performance increase is provided by incorporating overlapping patches on the original hyperspectral cube to create feature maps over multiple contiguous bands.
